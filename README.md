# Carbon Emissions Prediction Based on Car Model Analysis in North America
## Introduction

Urban planning in North America is designed to prioritize unlimited convenience for car drivers, often neglecting public transportation. As a result, people have limited options other than using cars for mobility. This phenomenon is highly problematic in the current climate crisis era, as studies have shown that a car-centric lifestyle is a major contributor to climate change. The United States, for instance, accounts for 29% of total greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector, making it the largest source compared to other sectors. This percentage is 5% higher than the transportation emissions proportion of European Union countries. Even more significant when compared to other developed countries like the Netherlands, where transportation emissions constitute 12.5% (European Parliamentary Research Service, 2021).

These figures highlight the need to transform the transportation sector into a more efficient and sustainable one in order to reduce carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the shift from private car usage to public transportation has not significantly occurred. Instead, there is a worrying trend in North America where consumers are increasingly inclined to purchase SUVs, which consume more fuel compared to smaller car models. The higher fuel consumption of SUVs is positively correlated with greenhouse gas emissions. If large vehicles like SUVs continue to dominate the roads, it is predicted that global transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions will further increase.

Given this background, it is necessary to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of a car model and its emission levels. These characteristics may include vehicle class, engine size, cylinders, transmission, and fuel type. The findings from such investigations can serve as a basis for formulating appropriate regulations related to the automotive industry, particularly for high-emission car products.

## Project Goals
The objectives of this final project are as follows:

- Identify the differences in carbon emission output between two groups of car types with different characteristics.
- Determine the relationship between the variables using regression analysis.
- Predict the emission levels (outcome variable) based on the predictor variables of car characteristics using a regression model.

## Datasets

### Description

The dataset used is obtained from the official website of the Canadian government and re-uploaded on Kaggle by Podder (2020). The dataset contains information on CO2 emission values with 11 features related to the characteristics of a car type from the year 2020 in Canada. The features in the dataset are as follows (Figure 1):
